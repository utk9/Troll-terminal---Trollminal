- friendly => let's play hangman, tic tac toe
- anger
- patience

error => "Do you know what you're doing?"
multiple cds => "I'm tired of moving around." (cursor stalls for 1 minute)
                  [your terminal is currently resting] <- any time a person tries to type
                  "zzzzzzzzzz"
"why don't you ever ask me how i'm doing?"
"im good! thx 4 asking :D"
[press r to respond, or just...]
